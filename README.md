# Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Description:

This project represented a multifaceted exploration of COVID-19 data, with the aim of providing a deeper understanding of the pandemic's global and regional dynamics. 

### Scope: 
The project encompassed a detailed analysis of COVID-19 data, with a focus on both global and regional aspects of the pandemic. Additionally, The second phase of the project involved integrating COVID-19 cases data with vaccination records to assess the progress of vaccination efforts in different regions.

### Tasks:
  - Data Querying and Sorting: The project involved complex SQL queries to extract and arrange data based on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and associated percentage metrics.

  - Data Integration: I skillfully combined COVID-19 cases data with vaccination records through data joins, ensuring that data from both sources could be effectively compared and analyzed.
  
  - Total Vaccinations: I calculated the total number of vaccinations administered in various locations, providing a clear picture of the scale of vaccination efforts.
  
  - Population Percentages: By calculating population percentages, the project offered insights into the reach of vaccination programs.

  - Visualization Preparation: I created temporary tables and views to facilitate data visualization, making the findings accessible and comprehensible.
  
### Insights and Trends: The analysis aimed to uncover trends and insights into the impact of the pandemic on various regions and continents, providing a more nuanced understanding of the crisis.

This comprehensive analysis and visualization project contributed to informed decision-making in the context of public health, providing a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact and vaccination progress. It underscored my proficiency in handling intricate data analysis tasks and refining my data engineering and visualization skills.
